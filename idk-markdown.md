### Viewing the Output

To see the output of this markdown file, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **Markdown Preview in a Code Editor**:
  - If you are using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, you can open the markdown file and use the built-in markdown preview feature. In VS Code, you can open the preview by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+V` or by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open Preview".

2. **Online Markdown Editors**:
  - You can copy the content of your markdown file and paste it into an online markdown editor like Dillinger (https://dillinger.io/) or StackEdit (https://stackedit.io/).

3. **Markdown Viewer Extensions**:
  - You can install browser extensions that render markdown files directly in the browser. For example, "Markdown Viewer" for Chrome or "Markdown Viewer Webext" for Firefox.

4. **Markdown to HTML Conversion**:
  - You can convert the markdown file to HTML using tools like Pandoc or markdown-it. For example, using Pandoc:
    ```sh
    pandoc /home/logicallybroke/dsa/AlgorithmsPart1/idk-markdown.md -o output.html
    ```
  - Then, open the `output.html` file in a web browser to see the rendered output.

5. **GitHub or GitLab**:
  - If you push your markdown file to a repository on GitHub or GitLab, you can view the rendered markdown directly on the platform.

Choose the method that best fits your workflow.
